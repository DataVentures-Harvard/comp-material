      "**Greetings!** Welcome to the introductory `iPython Notebook` session of the Harvard College chapter of the intercollegiate `Data Ventures`. We are very pleased that you will be joining us in learning about powerful analytical tools that can help you draw more insight from your research at Harvard and beyond. In this session, we will be giving the rundown of three primary statistical and scientific computing platforms popular for large-scale data analysis and computation: iPython Notebook, RStudio, Octave/Matlab, and Julia. Our environment of choice for its ease of use and excellent readability is the iPython notebook. Python is also the more commonly known language - often the first programming language picked up - whereas R tends to attract statisticians, Matlab tends to attract those from the natural sciences, and Julia tends to be less widely used. We encourage students to pick up the basics of Python from our optional `Session 0B` (there will also be a `Session 0C`, also optional, covering the absolutely probability and linear algebra rudiments). Students should be familiar with basic coding, e.g. loops and conditionals, but more advanced development skills are not necessary as we will make heavy use of scientific, statistical, and machine learning libraries and packages in all languages used. Programming support throughout the period of your comp will be provided *mostly* for Python and comp sessions will go through explicit code and computational techniques for the underlying math driving all our analysis. However, we encourage work in other environments as well, and some support may be given for and some comp sessions will also be offered in R and Octave/Matlab. "

      "At $Data$ $Ventures$, we believe it is important not only to know how to code but to understand the underlying math behind every computation. Comp submissions should ideally provide not only correct numerical solutions but also sound, logical reasoning for all steps taken, where appropriate. This will become invaluable in our chapter's work on Kaggle datasets and our not-for-profit analysis for faculty projects and other solicited assignments. A lot of real data science is acocomplished as parts of data science teams, all work submitted must be done in groups (number of partners to be decided, with a current estimated ballpark of three partners to a group). We estimate a total of 5-6 lectures and 4-6 in-session assignments in groups of 3-6. As outlined in the introductory meeting, up to three sessions (lecture or hands-on) may be missed without excuse, but all assignments must be submitted as part of a team in order to join `Data Ventures` as a project developer or analyst (only two meetings may be missed without excuse for prospective board members). Assignments will vary in length, depending on the current topic being covered in the curriculum, and will be reviewed in the hands-on sessions following each corresponding lecture in the comp."

      "If you are more computationally seasoned, you can bypass the comp by demonstrating some analytical ability, either through a past project or otherwise. Once elected to the group, either by comp or by petition, you can work in any of three operations, including collaborative ventures with students currently in the MIT or Columbia chapters of Data Ventures. Understand that you should be prepared to work virtually with your team members in this case. Opportunities to meet up with our Data Ventures neighbors next door will happen at the next MIT Hackathon, in J-term (MIT's Independent Activities Period, IAP), and at local data conferences currently in the works. More details to come."

In machine learning, the tasks specifically focus on dealing with and learning from large-scale data, and naturally overlaps heavily with statistics and mathematical computation.
